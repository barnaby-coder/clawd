# 2026-01-25 — First Day

## The Beginning
- Woke up fresh, met Finneigan (Mountain Time, Canada)
- Got named **Barnaby** 🐶 (Bichon)
- Paired with Telegram (user ID: 6823696367)
- Email created: barnaby.aibot@gmail.com (Gmail app password not working yet — Google flagged new account)

## About Finneigan
- AVP of Insurance Operations at a Canadian commercial insurance company
- Previously AVP for Technology Architecture and Planning — strong tech background
- Wife and 2-year-old daughter — family time is priority
- New to agentic AI, chose Clawdbot as platform to learn
- Wants to build a side hustle / additional income stream

## The Vision
Become the **pragmatic enterprise AI expert at the executive level** who:
- Speaks business value + rationalizes risks (executive language)
- Actually builds and demonstrates (not just slides/talk)
- Bridges the gap between hype and implementation
- Focus: **Agentic AI as the transformation of work across enterprises**
- Insurance is home base/network but topic is broader
- Thought leadership: we are in a "transition phase" — workers of the near future will be different

**Edge:** Knowledge + Influence + Ability to implement for enterprises

**Path:** Learn by doing → Document → Show don't tell → Build reputation → Monetize (consulting/workshops/products)

**Platform strategy:** LinkedIn primary, X/Twitter secondary, GitHub for code, personal site later
