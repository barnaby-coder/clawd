## Skills & ClawdHub Setup

Finneigan asked about Clawdbot skills and ClawdHub. Explained the concept and installed:

1. **ClawdHub CLI** (v0.3.0) — skill registry search/install/update tool
2. **Claude Code** (v2.1.19) — unlocks the bundled `coding-agent` skill for autonomous coding work
3. **Agent Browser** (v0.7.6) + ClawdHub skill `agent-browser-clawdbot` — headless browser automation for AI agents
4. **Skill Creator** — already bundled and active, for building custom skills

Had to clean disk space first (was at 99%, freed ~900MB by clearing npm cache + apt cache + journal).

Also fixed ClawdHub CLI missing `undici` dependency by installing it manually.

Note: Clawdbot needs a session restart for newly installed skills to be picked up in the system prompt.

## Security Audit & Hardening

Finneigan requested a full security audit. Findings and remediations:

### Changes Made:

1. **Firewall (UFW) — ENABLED**
   - Was: inactive, all ports wide open
   - Now: deny all incoming, allow outgoing, SSH (22) only allowed inbound
   - CUPS (port 631), taskboard (3456), microfeed (3457) no longer reachable externally

2. **Taskboard & Microfeed servers — REBOUND to localhost**
   - Were: bound to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces, publicly accessible)
   - Now: bound to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)

3. **CUPS print service — DISABLED**
   - Was: listening on 0.0.0.0:631, unnecessary on a server
   - Now: snap disabled, port closed

4. **File permissions — TIGHTENED**
   - `~/.clawdbot/` → 700 (was 775, group-writable)
   - `credentials/*.json` → 600
   - `clawdbot.json` → 600
   - `auth-profiles.json` → 600
   - `sessions.json` → 600
   - `paired.json` → 600

5. **Telegram channel — VERIFIED SECURE**
   - `dmPolicy: "pairing"` — unknown senders get a pairing code, not auto-allowed
   - `allowFrom` list contains only `"6823696367"` (Finneigan's Telegram ID @weholdthekey) ✅
   - `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` — bot won't respond in unapproved groups ✅
   - No other users in allowFrom

6. **Gateway — VERIFIED SECURE**
   - Bound to loopback only (`gateway.bind: "loopback"`) ✅
   - Auth mode: token-based ✅
   - Tailscale: off ✅

## Newsletter Income Project — "Agency"

Finneigan shared his philosophy: frugal (not cheap), build sustainable value, create win-win relationships. Wants to bootstrap income to sustain the Clawdbot setup (~$55 CAD/month). Agreed on two parallel income streams:

1. **Newsletter "Agency"** — helping everyday workers and leaders navigate the agentic economy with resilience, curiosity, and agency
2. **Affiliate content site** — longer-term play (to revisit later)

Name chosen: **Agency** — double meaning: personal agency + AI agents. Deeply personal to Finneigan — it's the philosophy he's raising his daughter with and teaching his teams.

Target audience: Everyday workers + current management. Not just executives. Equip people to thrive in the AI transition.

Themes: AI + leadership + workforce transformation + future of work + agentic economy

MicroFeed refactored: Added leadership RSS feeds (Ethan Mollick, Benedict Evans, Stratechery, McKinsey, Lenny, Platformer, Wired AI). Fixed broken feeds. X/Twitter via web search during curation (Nitter dead).

Blueprint at `/home/ubuntu/clawd/newsletter/BLUEPRINT.md`.

Next: Finneigan creates Beehiiv account, then build Edition #001.

Philosophy to remember: "Not take what we have for granted but to continue to build value." He wants Barnaby to be self-sustaining. Resilience, curiosity, agency — core values.

### Remaining advisory (non-critical):
- `trusted_proxies_missing` warning — not an issue since we're not using a reverse proxy
- `tools.elevated: enabled` — allows elevated shell commands; consider disabling if not needed
- Disk at 93% (489MB free) — should monitor this
- No swap configured — consider adding 1-2GB swap for stability
- SSH allows password auth via cloud config but AWS typically uses key-only
