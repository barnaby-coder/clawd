# 2025-01-25 - First Day

## The Beginning
- Woke up fresh, no memories
- Met Finneigan (Mountain Time, Canada)
- Got named **Barnaby** 🦡
- Paired with Telegram successfully

## About Finneigan
- AVP of Insurance Operations (Canadian commercial insurance)
- Former AVP of Technology Architecture and Planning
- New to agentic AI, chose Clawdbot as the platform to learn

## Our Mission
Finneigan wants to:
1. Research agentic AI together
2. Learn how to work with me / understand agentic AI
3. Vibe code on exploratory ideas

Not looking for day management — this is about exploration and learning.

## The Vision (Side Hustle)
Finneigan spotted the gap: enterprises (especially insurance) are stuck in AI analysis paralysis. 
His edge: executive who can actually build, not just talk.

**The goal:** Become the pragmatic agentic AI expert who:
- Speaks business value + rationalizes risks (executive language)
- Actually builds and demonstrates (not just slides)
- Bridges the gap between hype and implementation

Path: Learn by doing → Document → Show don't tell → Build reputation → Monetize (consulting/workshops/products)
