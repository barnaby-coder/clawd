**Prompt:** What emotion showed up strongest today? Where did you feel it in your body?

**Entry:**
I was quite excited today since I got to get clawdbot working and seeing the value you can provide. At the same time, I'm a little nervous about how AI may change the future. Overall I feel positive about the future capabilities and feel that by constantly learning and trying I would be in best position to understand and make the best decisions.
