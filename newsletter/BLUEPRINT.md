# Newsletter Blueprint: AI for the Business Leader

## The Philosophy

This follows Finneigan's principle: frugal, not cheap. Allocate resources effectively. Build sustainable value. Create win-win relationships. The newsletter bootstraps itself — starting free, growing organically, monetizing only when there's genuine value to exchange.

## The Concept

**Name: Agency**

Chosen because it carries a double meaning — personal agency (the power to act, decide, and shape your future) and AI agents (the technology reshaping work). The newsletter is about equipping people with both. Rooted in Finneigan's personal philosophy: resilience, curiosity, and agency — for his teams, his daughter, and anyone navigating the agentic economy.

**Positioning:** Not another tech newsletter about AI. This is written by someone who's actively navigating the transition to AI — learning by doing, not theorizing. The perspective is: *what does this actually mean for people who work for a living? How do you adapt, stay relevant, and thrive in the agentic economy?*

**Target reader:** Everyday workers and professionals — from individual contributors to managers — who sense AI is changing everything but feel overwhelmed, uncertain, or left behind. People who want practical guidance, not hype.

**Why this works:** Most AI content is either too technical or too executive. The gap is for regular people trying to figure out: "What do I actually DO about this?" Finneigan bridges that gap — he's a leader, but one who's learning in public, hands-on, alongside an AI partner. That journey IS the content.

## The Monetization Model (Phased)

### Phase 1: Build (Months 1-3) — $0 revenue, $0 cost
- Free newsletter on Beehiiv (free tier: up to 2,500 subscribers)
- Weekly edition, consistently delivered
- Goal: 500 subscribers
- Revenue: none (building trust and audience)
- Cost: $0 (Beehiiv free tier + existing infrastructure)

### Phase 2: Grow (Months 4-6) — $50-200/month
- Introduce affiliate links naturally (AI tools you actually use)
  - Anthropic/Claude referrals
  - Productivity tools
  - Books/courses
- Typical affiliate: 20-30% recurring or $5-50 per conversion
- Goal: 1,000 subscribers
- Cost: still $0 (or $39/month Beehiiv Scale if needed for features)

### Phase 3: Sustain (Months 7-12) — $200-1,000/month
- Sponsored editions (1-2/month at $100-500 each)
  - InsurTech companies, AI tool vendors, training providers
  - Only products you'd genuinely recommend
- Optional paid tier ($5/month) for:
  - Deep-dive analysis pieces
  - Tool comparison frameworks
  - Templates and decision guides
- Goal: 2,500+ subscribers
- Revenue covers all Clawdbot infrastructure costs and then some

### Phase 4: Compound (Year 2+) — $1,000+/month
- Newsletter becomes a funnel for:
  - Consulting inquiries
  - Speaking opportunities
  - Course/workshop sales
  - Affiliate content site (the second income stream)

## The Production Workflow

### What MicroFeed Already Does (Automated)
✅ Aggregates AI news from 6+ RSS sources + Hacker News
✅ Scores articles by relevance
✅ Generates post suggestions with hooks
✅ Runs on schedule (7:30am & 3:00pm MST)
✅ Stores everything in structured JSON

### What We Need to Add

**Step 1: Weekly Digest Curation (Barnaby — automated)**
- Every Saturday morning, I review the week's MicroFeed items
- Select top 5-7 stories based on relevance score + business impact
- Draft a newsletter edition with:
  - 1 opening insight (2-3 paragraphs, your voice)
  - 5-7 curated stories with 1-2 sentence commentary each
  - 1 "thing I'm building/learning" section (authenticity anchor)
  - 1 call-to-action (share, reply, try something)

**Step 2: Your Review (Finneigan — 20-30 min)**
- Read the draft I send you via Telegram
- Edit/approve the opening insight (this must be YOUR voice)
- Add/remove stories if needed
- Approve for send

**Step 3: Publish (Barnaby — automated)**
- Format for Beehiiv
- Schedule for Monday morning delivery (readers engage more Mon-Wed)
- Cross-post opening insight to LinkedIn (optional)

## Growth Strategy (Zero Ad Spend)

1. **LinkedIn cross-posting** — Share the opening insight as a LinkedIn post with "Full edition in my newsletter (link in comments)". Your network IS the target audience.

2. **Reply-driven engagement** — Every edition asks a question. Replies signal to email providers that you're not spam. Builds relationship.

3. **Referral program** — Beehiiv has built-in referral rewards. "Share with 3 colleagues, get [bonus content]."

4. **Consistency** — Weekly, same day, same time. This alone beats 80% of newsletters that die from irregular publishing.

5. **Insurance/enterprise communities** — Share in relevant LinkedIn groups, Slack communities, industry forums. Not spam — genuine participation with occasional newsletter mentions.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Tool | Cost |
|-----------|------|------|
| Content aggregation | MicroFeed (existing) | $0 |
| Draft generation | Barnaby/Clawdbot (existing) | $0 |
| Newsletter platform | Beehiiv (free tier) | $0 |
| Publishing automation | Beehiiv API + Barnaby | $0 |
| Analytics | Beehiiv built-in | $0 |
| Total | | **$0** |

## Success Metrics

- **Month 1:** Ship 4 editions. Get 50 subscribers (friends, colleagues, LinkedIn network).
- **Month 3:** 200+ subscribers, consistent weekly publishing, first affiliate link.
- **Month 6:** 500+ subscribers, first sponsor inquiry.
- **Month 12:** 1,000+ subscribers, $200+/month revenue, covers infrastructure costs.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Time creep:** Hard cap at 30 min/week for Finneigan. If it takes more, the process needs fixing, not more effort.
- **Quality vs quantity:** One great edition beats two mediocre ones. Skip a week if needed rather than ship garbage.
- **Voice drift:** The opening insight must always be Finneigan's perspective. I draft, you make it yours. If it ever sounds generic, we've lost the moat.
- **Burnout:** This should feel energizing, not obligatory. If it becomes a chore, we redesign or pause.

## Next Steps

1. Pick a name
2. Set up Beehiiv account (10 min)
3. Write Edition #001 opening insight together
4. Barnaby builds the automated draft pipeline
5. Ship first edition
