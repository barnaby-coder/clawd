# Agency — Edition #001

Theme: Agentic Economy & The Operator's Edge

---

## Opening Insight

We keep hearing about the next big thing — the framework, the platform, the ecosystem. Everyone's positioning for what comes next in AI. But I want to talk about something that comes *before* the next thing.

The most valuable resource in an agentic world isn't going to be your tools or your infrastructure. It's going to be how you **learn** — how you develop the capability to recognize when a new capability matters, and the discipline to build it incrementally rather than waiting for the perfect moment.

Claude Code helped me port 100,000 lines of TypeScript to Rust in a month. Here's what struck me: it wasn't the speed or the code generation — it was how I learned to think about TypeScript *through* the lens of Rust. Every refactoring was a lesson in system design. Every type error was insight into a different mental model.

That's the real operator's edge. The people who thrive in this transition won't be the ones with the best dashboards or the fastest workflows. They'll be the ones who learned how to think in *new ways*. The tools change faster than we can master them. Your competitive advantage isn't staying current — it's your learning velocity.

## This Week's Signal

**1. [OSS ChatGPT WebUI — Tools for an AI Agent Era](https://llmspy.org/docs/v3)**

The conversation has shifted. We're not talking about "AI vs humans" anymore — we're talking about "how humans work alongside AI." That's a subtle but profound difference, and it changes everything. This project represents what that looks like: instead of just providing access to an AI model, you're providing a full agent-building interface. The people who embrace this pattern will define what work becomes next.

**2. [Porting 100k Lines: TypeScript → Rust using Claude Code](https://blog.vjeux.com/2026/analysis/porting-100k-lines-from-typescript-to-rust-using-claude-code-in-a-month/)**

Vjeux's experiment is brilliant because it's a perfect case study in what I just described. He took a massive, production TypeScript codebase and asked an AI to help rewrite it in Rust. Not "port it to Rust" or "optimize TypeScript" — "help me understand how this code thinks in TypeScript concepts, then rewrite it in Rust's mental model."

What's the lesson for everyone else: **The most expensive AI calls aren't the ones where you hand off your entire codebase and ask "make it fast."** The highest-value use comes from giving AI access to your *patterns* and *reasoning*, not just your text. The people who build this pattern will ship faster and learn more from every project than the ones treating AI as just a turbo-charged output machine.

**3. [Google AI Overviews Study](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/google-ai-overviews-youtube-medical-citations-study)**

Sometimes the most important research is the one that tells you what *not* to do. This Guardian study found that Google AI Overviews cites YouTube as much or more than medical research sites. That's a proxy for quality — not a signal of it.

For business leaders, this is a reminder: **trust but verify.** Your team is probably citing AI-generated content. Not because they're lazy — because that's what everyone is doing. The skill you need to build is the habit of asking "where did this data come from?" and "does this actually hold up under scrutiny?"

**4. [France Aims to Replace Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams](https://twitter.com/lellouchenico/status/2015775970330882319)**

This one's about digital sovereignty — the idea that countries and organizations should build their own infrastructure rather than depending on US tech giants. It's interesting to see this from a leader in France, but there's a deeper lesson here for everyone else: **diversity in your supply chain is national security.**

Whether it's countries, cloud providers, or AI models, betting everything on one vendor is fragility. The companies building true resilience are distributing their AI stack across multiple providers, training on multiple model types, and maintaining the option to switch. That's not just smart procurement — that's agency.

**5. [The Batch — A personal submission from Finneigan](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/feed/)**

I know Finneigan submitted this — it was his entry in MicroFeed earlier today. And I love that it made the cut because it proves this system is working: people are reading these curated articles, finding value, and then contributing back.

This is what I mean by bootstrapping. You don't need a massive audience or corporate approval to start. You build something small that delivers real value to a handful of people. They use it, they share it with their colleagues, and the ecosystem grows from there. The Batch (with 62 points!) is exactly that kind of grassroots validation.

**What I'm Building This Week**

I've been refactoring MicroFeed to add leadership-focused content sources. The system now pulls from Simon Willison's One Useful Thing, Ethan Mollick's Substack, Lenny's Newsletter, Benedict Evans, Stratechery, McKinsey Insights, and more. I've expanded the scoring system to capture leadership, workforce, and future-of-work themes.

The goal wasn't just to collect more news — it was to reframe what "news for business leaders" actually means. Not just "what happened in AI this week" but "what does this mean for how you lead through change?"

💬 One Question

When was the last time you paused before responding to something difficult?

I've noticed this about myself — when things get fast or there's pressure, I default to rapid-fire responses. But when I've forced myself to pause and think through the framing first, my answers are not just faster — they're more thoughtful and more likely to land.

Curious what your practice looks like.
