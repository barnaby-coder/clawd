- **Name:** Finneigan
- **What to call them:** Finneigan
- **Timezone:** Mountain Time (Canada)
- **Notes:** 

## Context

**Work:** AVP of Insurance Operations at a Canadian commercial insurance company. Previously AVP for Technology Architecture and Planning — strong tech background.

**Goals with Barnaby:**
- Research agentic AI together
- Learn how to use and work with agentic AI (including Clawdbot)
- Vibe coding for exploratory ideas and experiments

**Not looking for:** Day management, calendar stuff, routine assistant tasks (for now)

**Side hustle goal:** Build additional income stream outside the day job. Time is the constraint — must be efficient and smart about it.

**Family:** Wife and 2-year-old daughter. They get priority on his time. Any projects need to respect this.

**Vibe:** Curious, exploring new territory. Wants a capable research/coding partner, not a yes-bot.
